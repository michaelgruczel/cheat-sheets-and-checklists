# cheat-sheet-retrperspective
 
In case you want to do a retro, but you have no smart idea, this list might help.

Don't select something you like, instead think about what type of retro is needed for the use case. The type of retro defines the results you can get, people who always use the same technic or just select randomly are just wasting the time of the participants.

## Set up / Ice breaker / get into the retro

In order to get into the retro modus, open questions are effective, this questions can help the participants to remember the last sprint(s).
Within a reound everyone can give a statement to one or two open questions, for example:

* How do you felt during the last sprint ?
* What was the most important element ?
* What was the biggest problem ?
* What took the most time ?
* Why are we donting retros ?
* In one word - What is your expectation of a retro ?
* In one word - What do you have in mind ?
* In which emotiotional state are you (e.g. 'happy', 'disappointed',...) ?

## Gathering data

* Rate the sprint like a book review at amazon (Title, Content, Star rating (5 stars is the best))
* Have a look at every story of the last sprint and search for problems and improvements
* collect notes during the sprint and check them now
* every participant will write down some events, and together you order them in time
* articipants write a postcard including their feelings and thoughts
* Brainstorming about behaviour you want to keep, remove, add, ..
* Image a perfect next iteration, hwo would it look like
* create a Spider Graph
* Start, Stop, continoue
* "Liked – Learned – Lacked – Longed"
* Imagine a sailing ship. What are ankers, what is wind from front, and what is wind from back ?
* use circles when collecting improvement ideas (inner circle - in our control, middle ring -we can influence, outer ring - no chance to influence)
