# checklist presentations

If you have created a presentation, ask yourself:

* what is the value your presentation provides ? the presentation is for the audience and not for you, there should be a value add.
* Do you have long texts and explanations on your slides ? presentations are no documentations, you should not read the content, the slides are just a guide, the content should come from you. People are not able to read and listen, means if they read they will not listen to you, use pictures and diagrams, or if realy needed some buzzwords
* is it possible to see the slides from the last row ?
* use good readable font and not a fancy, but not usable font (30px)
* keep it simple, a presentation is not the right place for complex things
* check again every slide, is every slide usefull and understandable ?
* Have you reserved some time for questions ?
* Less is more, if you present 20 minutes and you suck, it's only 20 minutes, if you are great they will ask for more, if you present 1 hour and you suck, then they will hate you
* have you prepared the presentation itself ?
* after the presentation, check whether you want to send out links or whether you collcted some action items
* showing is better than telling
* do you believe in it ?
* could you do the presentation without notes and without a beamer ? if not prepare better, even if you will use the notes
* Is there an agenda in it
* normally people will just remember some items, so take sure that you have some core concepts to remember
* ask for feedback before and after
